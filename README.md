# Cube Puzzle 3D ![icon](/public/favicon-16x16.png)

This project is my first game developed with Three.js.

I make the models in Blender and the game with React.

I've used :
- React Three Fiber and Drei for the Three.js part
- Rapier for physics
- Zustand for state management
- GSAP for animation

This project is inspired by INSIDEÂ³ from Romain-Guirec Piotte.
