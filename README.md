# Cube Puzzle 3D ![icon](/public/favicon-16x16.png)

## Informations

This project is my first game developed with Three.js.

I make the models in Blender and the game with React.

I've used :
- **[React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)** and **[Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)** for the Three.js part
- **[Rapier](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier)** for physics
- **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** for state management
- **[GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP)** for animation
- **[React Joystick Component](https://github.com/elmarti/react-joystick-component)** for mobile joystick

This project is inspired by INSIDEÂ³ from Romain-Guirec Piotte.
